<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cam.cornell.edu">Center for Applied Mathematics</a> at Cornell University, where I 
	am fortunate to work with <a href="https://cee.cornell.edu/samitha/">Samitha Samaranayake</a>. My research interests are in the 
	fields of combinatorial optimization and online decision-making.
</p>
<p>
	My career path took a dramatic turn after my first semester at Cornell, when I took courses 
	with <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/">Bobby Kleinberg</a> and <a href="https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shmoys/">David 
	Shmoys</a>. It was through them that I discovered my passion for mathematics and theoretical computer science, which led me to 
	rethink my doctoral plan and to ultimately switch academic programs. David and Bobby were both supportive in this 
	transition and are now in my dissertation committee.
</p>	
<p>
	I received a <a href="https://cee.illinois.edu/">Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering</a> and a 
	<a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">Minor in Computer Science</a> from the University of Illinois 
	at Urbana-Champaign in May 2017. While at Illinois, I was advised by <a href="https://lab-work.github.io/">Dan Work</a> 
	(now at Vanderbilt University). My research included traffic esimation in safety-critical environments as well as 
	applied machine-learning for freight-rail systems. Between Illinois and Cornell, I was a Bosch Energy Research 
	Network (BERN) intern at Bosch North America. My supervisor was 
	<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=94F8PNsAAAAJ&hl=en/">Shyam Jade</a>. My work included city-scale 
	agent-based traffic simulation.
