I am a first year PhD student in Systems at Cornell University. My advisor is [Samitha Samaranayake](https://cee.cornell.edu/samitha/). Prior to joining Cornell, I was a research intern at Bosch.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2017.
