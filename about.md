I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from The George Washington University in Spring 2015. While at GWU, I was an active member of the community where I spent a large amount of time making sure that other students felt welcome and wouldn’t fall behind. I also worked through the ACM student chapter as president to make the CS department’s community more social between faculty and students. 

During my undergraduate studies, I performed research with [Tim Wood](http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/~timwood/) in the [Cloud Systems Lab](https://cloudlab.seas.gwu.edu) where I worked on topics related to Virtualization and Security. I also worked for The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Computing Facility where I was a Jr. Information Security and Compliance Analyst. I helped respond to security incidents on the network and assisted with system administration tasks.

In Fall 2013, I studied abroad in London, UK at University College London. It was great exposure to a different style of teaching and university atmosphere. I was able to experience how CS courses are taught abroad and how talented students were at UCL. Living in London was awesome and it quickly became my favorite city and I hope to return in the future. London is also where I learned to play the sport of darts as part of a local university dart league. 

In Fall 2016, I started the Phd program at The University of Massachusetts Amherst. I work in the [Lass Lab](http://lass.cs.umass.edu) with [Prashant Shenoy](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/home). I have worked on evaluating the different forms of Virtualization and their pro's and con's for different environments. This work is published [here](/research/containers-vms/). I am currently working on evaluating multipath transport protocols and their place in and between data centers.


# Rock Climbing

During a particularly uneventful summer in Amherst I decided to join the [local rock gym](https://www.centralrockgym.com/hadley/) and have loved climbing ever since. I find that climbing allows me to free my mind while also performing a form of active problem solving. It also has allowed me to meet some really cool people that are also into the sport. I stick to mainly top rope but venture into bouldering when I’m stressed and can’t find a belay partner. 
I’m currently climbing 5.9 routes and continuously working towards higher difficulty. 

I am also currently training 
for the lead climbing class at my gym and hope to take the class during February 2017. Hopefully if all goes well, I will be able to move outdoors during summer 2017.
If you are in Amherst and want to give climbing a try, 
let me know and I can show you the ropes! (Ha ha!)

# Travelling

Like many 20-somethings I have a bit of wanderlust and seek to travel any chance I can get. During the summer before I started graduate school, I traveled through Thailand, Myanmar (or Burma), and India with a group of close friends. It was a fantastic experience getting to know other cultures and local customs and I even learned a lot about myself. I hope to take some time each year to travel to new locations and experience the cultures of the world. Hopefully a conference or two will take me somewhere far and interesting! 

# Human Geography

-->
During my senior year of high school I took what was known as the easiest AP class: Human Geography. It quickly turned into my favorite class and sparked my interest in studying people and their interaction with their communities and environment through movement across space and place. I took another class in my undergraduate studies at GW that was amazing and further encouraged my interest in the topic. I now spend a fair amount of my time reading books that broach the subject of human geography and hope that some day my research may intersect with it.
