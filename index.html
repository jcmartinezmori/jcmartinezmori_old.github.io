<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	I am a first year PhD student in <a href="http://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/">Systems</a> at Cornell University.
	My advisor is <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/home">Samitha Samaranayake</a>. My research interests 
	lie in the intersection of transportation systems engineering and theoretical computer science. I am interested 
	in developing (or simply using) state-of-the-art algorithms for transportation-related applications. On the theory 
	side, I am interested in online algorithms, approximation algorithms, and parametrized algorithms. On the 
	applications side, I am interested in incorporating a demand-responsive component in public transportation. In 
	particular, I am interested in i) the integration of public transportation and mobility on-demand, and ii) the 
	operations of a bus line with pop-up stops.
