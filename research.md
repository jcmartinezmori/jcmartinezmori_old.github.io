## The Batched Set Cover Problem [[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10767)]
With Samitha Samaranayake.

This research started as my final project for Bobby Kleinberg's course. I was interested in modeling an on-demand transit system with 'pop-up' bus stops, similar to what [Via](https://ridewithvia.com/) does, as an online set cover problem. In this application, the potential passenger pickup and dropoff locations are fixed, but they are only brought into the solution as travel requests arrive. Something didn't quite make sense though; travel requests are usually processed in batches rather than one-by-one, precisely to leverage compatibility between them. Of course, in the worst-case adversarial setting, the adversary reveals batches that mimic the worst-case adversary for the well-studied online setting. To handle this, I instead explored the setting in which the adversary is required to reveal batches of at least certain VC-dimension. It appears that this requirement can be levearged by primal-dual algorithms to improve their competitive factor by some constant, but I wasn't able to demonstrate this mathematically. Still, I showed some lower bounds, eexplored this idea computationally, and motivated an intuitive primal-dual algorithm with simultaneous dual-variable updates.
