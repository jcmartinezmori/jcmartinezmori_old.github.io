<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	I am a first year PhD student in <a href="http://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/">Systems</a> at Cornell University.
	My advisor is <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/home">Samitha Samaranayake</a>. My research interests 
	lie in the intersection of transportation systems engineering and theoretical computer science. I am interested 
	in developing (or simply using) state-of-the-art algorithms for transportation-related applications. On the theory 
	side, I am interested in online algorithms, approximation algorithms, and parametrized algorithms. On the 
	applications side, I am interested in incorporating a demand-responsive component in public transportation. In 
	particular, I am interested in i) the integration of public transportation and mobility on-demand, and ii) the 
	operations of bus and shuttle systems with pop-up stops.
</p>
	
<p>
	I received a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science from the University of Illinois 
	at Urbana-Champaign. While at Illinois, I worked with <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/danwork/">Dan Work</a> (now
	at Vanderbilt University). My research included traffic esimation in safety-critical environments and machine-learning
	in freight-rail applications. Between Illinois and Cornell, I was a Bosch Energy Research Network (BERN) intern at 
	Bosch North America. My supervisor was Shyam Jade, PhD. My work included city-scale agent-based traffic simulation as
	well as applied machine-learning.
