## Interests

I am broadly interested in the intersection of transportation and algorithms. On the transportation side, I am interested in both the operations and broader impacts of high-occupancy modes of transportation such as public transit and high-capacity ridesharing. On the algorithms side, I am interested in approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, parametrized algorithms, and online algorithms.
