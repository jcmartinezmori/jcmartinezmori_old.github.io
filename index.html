<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	I am a first year PhD student in <a href="http://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/">Systems</a> at Cornell University.
	My advisor is <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/home">Samitha Samaranayake</a>. My research interests 
	lie in the intersection of transportation systems engineering and theoretical computer science. I am interested 
	in developing (or simply using) state-of-the-art algorithms for transportation-related applications. On the theory 
	side, I am interested in online algorithms, approximation algorithms, and parametrized algorithms. On the 
	applications side, I am interested in incorporating a demand-responsive component in public transportation. In 
	particular, I am interested in i) the integration of public transportation and mobility on-demand, and ii) the 
	operations of bus and shuttle systems with pop-up stops.
</p>
	
<p>
	I received a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science from the University of Illinois 
	at Urbana-Champaign in May 2017. While at Illinois, I worked with <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/danwork/">Dan Work</a> 
	(now at Vanderbilt University). My research included traffic esimation in safety-critical environments as well as 
	applied machine-learning for freight-rail systems. Between Illinois and Cornell, I was a Bosch Energy Research 
	Network (BERN) intern at Bosch North America. My supervisor was 
	<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=94F8PNsAAAAJ&hl=en/">Shyam Jade</a>. My work included city-scale 
	agent-based traffic simulation as well as applied machine-learning for i) population synthesis, and ii) studying 
	engine data.
