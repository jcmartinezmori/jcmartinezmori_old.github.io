<h2>About</h2>
<p>	
	I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.cam.cornell.edu">Center for Applied Mathematics</a> at Cornell University, where I 
	am fortunate to work with <a href="https://cee.cornell.edu/samitha/">Samitha Samaranayake</a>. My minor committee members are 
	<a href="https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shmoys/">David Shmoys</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/">Bobby Kleinberg</a>, and 
	<a href="https://www.pamelaeharris.com/">Pamela Harris</a>.
	Mathematically, I'm interested in combinatorial optimization, particularly in approximation algorithms and online decision-making. In terms 
	of applications, I'm interested in the urban environment, particularly in mobility.
</p>
<p>
	In Spring 2023, I will visit the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) as a participant for the semester-long program
	<a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s23/">Discrete Optimization: Mathematics, Algorithms, and Computation</a>. 
	In Summer 2022, I was a Teaching Assistant for <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/summerug/2022/">Summer@ICERM 2022: Computational Combinatorics</a>, 
	an REU program hosted by the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM).
	In Summer 2021, I was a Teaching Assistant for <a href="https://www.msri.org/msri_ups/967">MSRI-UP 2021: Parking Functions: Choose your own adventure</a>, 
	an REU program hosted by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), and especially designed for students from groups underrepresented in mathematics.
	In Fall 2020, I "visited" the UCLA Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) as a participant for the semester-long program <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/mathematical-challenges-and-opportunities-for-autonomous-vehicles/">
	Mathematical Challenges and Opportunities for Autonomous Vehicles</a>, which took place online due to the pandemic. 
	In Summer 2020, I was a Research Science Intern at Amazon, where I worked on a machine assignment problem for order fullfilment. 
	In Summer 2017, I was Bosch Energy Research Network Intern, where I worked on traffic microsimulation.
</p>

<p>
	I received a <a href="https://cee.illinois.edu/">Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering</a> and a 
	<a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">Minor in Computer Science</a> from the University of Illinois 
	at Urbana-Champaign in May 2017. While at Illinois, I was advised by <a href="https://lab-work.github.io/">Dan Work</a> 
	(now at Vanderbilt University). My research included traffic esimation in safety-critical environments as well as applied 
	machine-learning for freight-rail systems.
</p>
	
<p>
	I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayaquil">Guayaquil, Ecuador</a>. In high school, I had 
	the opportunity to complete the <a href="https://www.ibo.org/">International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme</a>, which 
	motivated me to pursue a career in STEM. I was able to complete my undergraduate education in the United States through a 
	generous scholarship awarded by the Government of Ecuador. 
</p>
<p>
	I find the following axioms, which I discovered <a href="https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf">
	here</a>, to be truly inspiring and empowering:
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
		<li>
			<i>Axiom 1</i>. Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, 
			demographic, and economic boundaries.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Axiom 2</i>. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Axiom 3</i>. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various 
			communities to serve their needs. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Axiom 4</i>. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. 
		</li>
      	</ul>
</p>
<h3>About My Last Name</h3>
<p>
	In formal settings (e.g., legal documents, publications), it is Martínez Mori; two words separated by a space, not a hyphen. 
	In informal settings, it is just Martínez.
