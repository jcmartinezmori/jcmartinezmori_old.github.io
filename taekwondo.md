I received my 1st Dan Black Belt (Kukkiwon No. 05431493) from Walter Romero in Guayaquil, Ecuador. I had a short-lived competition attempt in 2017, when I participated with the Cornell Sport Taekwondo team at the ECTC Brown University Tournament (I was totally destroyed in my fight). I still train with the Cornell Sport Taekwondo team, and may consider going to a tournament again later on.
