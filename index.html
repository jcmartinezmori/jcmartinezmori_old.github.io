<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	I am a second year PhD student in <a href="http://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/">Systems</a> at Cornell University.
	My advisor is <a href="https://cee.cornell.edu/samitha/">Samitha Samaranayake</a>. My research interests lie in 
	the intersection of transportation engineering, urban planning, operations research, and computer science. In 
	particular, I am interested in improving our transportation systems with novel operational models and algorithms
	that emphasize i) a principled approach to problem solving and ii) real-world practical considerations. On the
	practical side, I am interested in the broader impacts of our transportation systems, especially as it pertains to
	the inception of high-occupancy modes of transportation and the reduction of single-passenger trips. On the 
	theoretical side, I am broadly interested algorithms, including online algorithms, approximation algorithms, 
	and parametrized algorithms. I am interested in algorithms that exploit the structure of particular kinds of problem 
	instances, making them 'easier' to solve than they would be otherwise.

<p>
	I received a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science from the University of Illinois 
	at Urbana-Champaign in May 2017. While at Illinois, I was advised by <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/danwork/">Dan Work</a> 
	(now at Vanderbilt University). My research included traffic esimation in safety-critical environments as well as 
	applied machine-learning for freight-rail systems. Between Illinois and Cornell, I was a Bosch Energy Research 
	Network (BERN) intern at Bosch North America. My supervisor was 
	<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=94F8PNsAAAAJ&hl=en/">Shyam Jade</a>. My work included city-scale 
	agent-based traffic simulation.
