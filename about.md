I am a first year MS/PhD student in Computer Science at the University Of Massachusetts Amherst. My area of focus is in cloud computing, virtualization and distributed systems, though my interests cross into the boundaries of security and privacy as well. I also like to study all aspects of computer science and how they interact with people and the surrounding world. I have also discovered a new interest in bitcoin after taking the Multidisciplinary Study of Security and Privacy course at UMass. While the currency is interesting, the distributed systems and decentralization concepts behind it are far more fascinating.

When I am not busy doing research or coursework, I often find myself drifting into various thought experiments for fun. Who knows maybe some day they'll lead to an interesting project! I also like to write, especially stories of fiction, although many remain unfinished. On my undergraduate study abroad trip to London, I discovered the sport of darts and have loved it ever since.
