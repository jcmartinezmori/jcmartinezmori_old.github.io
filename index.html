<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I am a second year MS/PhD student working in the <a href="http://lass.cs.umass.edu">LASS Lab</a> with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/home">Prashant Shenoy</a> at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My area of focus is in cloud computing, virtualization and distributed systems, though my interests cross into the boundaries of security and privacy as well. Currently we are evaluating the performance of Multipath transport protocols and their place in the data center.</p>

<p>
Apart from my area of focus, I enjoy studying all aspects of computer science and how they interact with people and the surrounding world. As part of my commitment to reproducible research, I am currently evaluating a workflow for an open research notebook and hope to have it up and running on this page soon (~1/1/2017).</p>
<p>
When I am not busy doing research or coursework, I often find myself drifting into various thought experiments for fun. Who knows maybe some day they'll lead to an interesting project! During some downtime in Amherst, I recently discovered rock climbing and have quickly become addicted to it. I find it serves as a nice escape from grad school and allows me to use my brain in a different way. I hope to start Lead climbing during the Spring 2017 semester. On my undergraduate study abroad trip to London, I discovered the sport of darts and have loved it ever since.
