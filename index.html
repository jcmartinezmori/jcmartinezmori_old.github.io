<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I am a second year MS/PhD student working in the <a href="http://lass.cs.umass.edu">LASS Lab</a> with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/home">Prashant Shenoy</a> at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My area of focus is in cloud computing, virtualization and distributed systems, though my interests cross into the boundaries of security and privacy as well. Currently we are evaluating the performance of Multipath transport protocols and their place in the data center.</p>

<p>
Apart from cloud computing, I enjoy studying all aspects of computer science and how they interact with people and the surrounding world. As part of my commitment to reproducible research, I maintain an open research notebook that details my weekly research progress and any interesting thoughts that I have. I hope to later include how-to's on how to replicate experiments from my papers. My notebook can be found <a href="mrlucasch.github.io/notebook">here</a>.</p>
<p>
When I am not busy doing research or coursework, I often find myself drifting into various thought experiments for fun. Who knows maybe some day they'll lead to an interesting project! During some downtime in Amherst, I recently discovered rock climbing and have quickly become addicted to it. I find it serves as a nice escape from grad school and allows me to use my brain in a different way. On my undergraduate study abroad trip to London, I discovered the sport of darts and have loved it ever since.
